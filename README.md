# pyth-test

Prints out Pyth's product accounts and pricing accounts.

This is an attempt to understand how to use Pyth. The code is taken nearly exactly from https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client-rs/blob/main/examples/get_accounts.rs, though
with additional comments and some refactoring for learning purposes.

To run:
```
cargo run
```
